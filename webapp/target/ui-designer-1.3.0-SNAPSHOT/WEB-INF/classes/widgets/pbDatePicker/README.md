# pbDatePicker

Widget based on angular-strap date picker. 
`bs-datepicker` directive has been patched to fit our needs, you'll get patched code here: https://github.com/bonitasoft/angular-strap/pull/1

**WARNING: angular-strap.compat.min.js must be used to avoid collision with ui-bootstrap.js**

If you need to update angular-strap-2.3.5.compat.min.js library, be careful that all implemented tests pass otherwise you surely have broken something ;-)
