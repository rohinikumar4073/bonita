<translate>Use an interpolation field to enter text to display in the widget. The
                    text can include variables that
                    are interpreted using AngularJS interpolation. When the page is displayed, the variables are
                    replaced by
                    the interpolated values. Specify a variable as a simple expression enclosed in double braces, using
                    the
                    same format as for a dynamic value field.
                    Example: I'm sorry, <em ng-non-bindable="">{{ user.name | uppercase }}</em>. I'm afraid I can't do that.
