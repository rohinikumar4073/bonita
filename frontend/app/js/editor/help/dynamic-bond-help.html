<translate> Use a dynamic value field to specify a constant (the default) or an expression. Click the
                    expression
                    icon fx to switch from constant to expression. Click the constant icon X to switch from expression
                    to
                    constant. An expression can include a variable to make the property value dynamic, or can simply be
                    the
                    name of a variable. You can apply a filter to a variable value using a pipe. The binding to the
                    variable
                    is a read. If you want to write to the variable, use a bidirectional bond.
