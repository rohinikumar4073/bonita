                Use the UI Designer to create or edit web artifacts: <b>application pages</b> composing business
                applications, <b>process forms</b> linked to process instantiation or human
                tasks execution, as well as <b>application layouts</b>, applied to all pages of a business application.
            </p>
            <p translate>Artifact creation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li translate>Create an <b>application page</b> directly in the UI Designer</li>
                <li translate>Start creating a <b>process form</b> in Bonita BPM Studio: from the appropriate pool or
                    human task, create a contract and launch the UI Designer. It will auto-generate a dedicated form to
                    edit.
                </li>
                <li translate>Start creating an <b>application layout</b> by importing the default layout, available in
                    the Bonita BPM Portal
                    resources, and edit it.

                An artifact designed with the UI Designer can be exported to be shared with teammates (import in the UI
                Designer) or used in business applications (import in Bonita BPM Portal).
